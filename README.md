# Air Pollution Charts

Introducing Air Pollution Charts - a personal project and tech challenge I took on to explore the possibilities of React, Node, JavaScript, and TypeScript. Using these powerful tools, I built a platform that provides real-time global air pollution data through rich and interactive data visualizations. The platform incorporates Plotly, a versatile data visualization library that offers a wide range of chart types, from basic line graphs to 3D visualizations. I've also utilized react-spring technology to enhance animations and provide a seamless user experience.

## The platform is built on a foundation of four key technologies:

• [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A popular and widely-used JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

• [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - A superset of JavaScript that adds static type definitions to improve code safety and maintainability.

• [Plotly](https://plotly.com/graphing-libraries/) - A data visualization library that allows users to create a wide range of chart types, from basic line graphs to 3D visualizations.

• [react-spring](https://react-spring.io/) - A powerful animation library for React that allows us to create smooth, fluid animations that enhance the user experience.
