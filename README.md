# Air Pollution Charts

Introducing Air Pollution Charts - a personal project and tech challenge I took on to explore the possibilities of React, Node, JavaScript, and TypeScript. Using these powerful tools, I built a platform that provides real-time global air pollution data through rich and interactive data visualizations. The platform incorporates Plotly, a versatile data visualization library that offers a wide range of chart types, from basic line graphs to 3D visualizations. I've also utilized react-spring technology to enhance animations and provide a seamless user experience.
